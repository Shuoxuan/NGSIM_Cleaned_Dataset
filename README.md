# NGSIM Cleaned Dataset

We took some effort to clean the [Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM)](https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficanalysistools/ngsim.htm) dataset. We are excited to share with traffic researchers and engineers who are in need of a cleaner version.

Here are some comparison with the raw data

Result Tabular | Raw NGSIM data | Our Reconstructed Data 
--- | --- | --- |
Mean of speed | 26.21 | 26.03
Std of speed | 12.90 | 12.99
Mean of accleration | -0.09 | 0.03
Std of accleration | 5.43 | 1.98
MSE of position between dataset and ground truth | 24.71 | 23.69
MSE of speed between dataset and ground truth  | 7.98 | 3.34
MSE of accleration between dataset and ground truth  | 29.97 | 2.81
