# NGSIM Cleaned Dataset

We took some effort to reconstruct the [Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM)](https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficanalysistools/ngsim.htm) dataset. We are excited to share with traffic researchers and engineers who are in need of the cleaned version. 
The reconstruction method is published on the jornal of Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, titled [An integrated Empirical Mode Decomposition and Butterworth filter based vehicle trajectory reconstruction method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437121005689)
